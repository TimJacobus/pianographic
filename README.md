Consider that the intended end-result of this has always been to create an infographic image. It's not meant to be dynamic. Hence the lack of media queries and features that add user interaction. 

My only concern was for it to look good and for it to be readable on all devices. The way it is, it can be read on a phone in landscape mode.

I do realize it isn't necessarily the best usecase of React, but I wanted to practice using React and its small component workflow. There's no state, but I used props wherever I could.

The JavaScript behind the infographic, most of which can be found inside src/Data , is what took the most work and is what best showcases where I am in terms of coding at the time of creating this project.
It was my aim to keep things dynamic as much as possible, as I look to reuse this next year (though, it will be improved to reflect my programming abilities at that time).
Another goal is to eventually turn this into part of a website, where a (simpler) infographic gets created based on user inputs (the input will probably be handled through a stopwatch sort of App).
